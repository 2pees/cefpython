## Introduction

CEF Python is an open source project founded by [Czarek Tomczak](http://www.linkedin.com/in/czarektomczak) in 2012 to provide python bindings for the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef). See the growing list of [applications using CEF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework#Applications_using_CEF) on wikipedia. Examples of embedding CEF browser are available for many popular GUI toolkits including: [wxPython](../../wiki/wxPython), [PyGTK](../../wiki/PyGTK), [PyQt](../../wiki/PyQt), [PySide](../../wiki/PySide), [Kivy](../../wiki/Kivy), [Panda3D](../../wiki/Panda3D) and [PyWin32](../master/cefpython/cef3/windows/binaries_32bit/pywin32.py).

Some use cases for CEF: 

* Embed a web browser control with great HTML5 support (based on Chromium)
* Use it to create a HTML5 based GUI in an application. This can act as a replacement for GUI toolkits like wxWidgets/Qt/Gtk. For native communication between javascript and python use [javascript bindings](../../wiki/JavascriptBindings). Another option is to run an internal python web server and use websockets/XMLHttpRequest for js&lt;&gt;python communication. This way you can write a desktop app in the same way you write web apps. 
* Render web content off-screen in applications that use custom drawing frameworks. See the [Kivy](../../wiki/Kivy) and [Panda3D](../../wiki/Panda3D) examples.
* Use it for automated testing of existing web applications. Use it for web scraping, or as a web crawler or other kind of internet bots.


## Compatibility
