## Introduction

CEF Python is an open source project founded by [Czarek Tomczak](http://www.linkedin.com/in/czarektomczak)
in 2012 to provide python bindings for the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef).
See the growing list of [applications using CEF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework#Applications_using_CEF)
on wikipedia. Examples of embedding CEF browser are available for many
popular GUI toolkits including: wxPython, PyGTK, PyQt, PySide, Kivy,
Panda3D, PyWin32 and PyGame/PyOpenGL.

There are many use cases for CEF. You can embed a web browser control
based on Chromium with great HTML 5 support. You can use it to create
a HTML 5 based GUI in an application, this can act as a replacement for
standard GUI toolkits like wxWidgets, Qt or GTK. You can render web
content off-screen in application that use custom drawing frameworks.
You can use it for automated testing of existing applications. You can
use it for web scraping or as a web crawler, or other kind of internet
bots.
