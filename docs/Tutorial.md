# Tutorial

With CEF Python you can embed a web browser control based
on Chromium in a Python application. You can also use it to
create a HTML 5 based GUI in an application that can act as
a replacement for standard GUI toolkits such as wxWidgets,
Qt or GTK. With this tutorial you will learn CEF Python
basics. This tutorial will discuss the two basic examples:
[hello_world.py](../examples/hello_world.py)
and [tutorial.py](../examples/tutorial.py). There are more
many more examples that you can find in the [Examples-README.md](../examples/Examples-README.md)
file, but these examples are out of scope for this tutorial.

## Install and run example

You can install with pip. On Linux pip 8.1+ is required. Alternatively
you can download packages for offline installation from [GitHub Releases](../../../releases).

Run the commands below to install the cefpython3 package, clone
the github repository, enter the examples/ directory and run the
Hello World example:

```
pip install cefpython3==56.1
git clone https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython.git
cd cefpython/examples/
python hello_world.py
```

The hello_world.py example's source code will be analyzed line
by line in the next section of this Tutorial.

This tutorial in its further sections will also reference the
tutorial.py example which will show how to use more advanced
CEF Python features. The tutorial.py example is also available
in the examples/ directory.


## Hello world

The [hello_world.py](../examples/hello_world.py) example is the
most basic example. It doesn't depend on any third party GUI framework.
It creates a browser widget without providing any window information
(parent window is not specified), thus CEF automatically takes care of
creating a top-level window, and in that window a Chromium widget
is being embedded. When creating the browser, the "url" parameter is
specified, which causes the browser to initially navigate to
Google website. Let's analyze the code from that example:

1. `from cefpython3 import cefpython as cef` - Import the cefpython
   module and make a short "cef" alias
2. `sys.excepthook = cef.ExceptHook` - Overwrite Python's default
   exception handler so that all CEF sub-processes are terminated
   when Python exception occurs. To understand this better read the
   "Architecture" and "Handling Python exceptions" sections
   further down in this Tutorial.
3. `cef.Initialize()` - Initialize CEF. This function must be called
   somewhere in the beginning of your code. It must be called before
   any application window is created. It must be called only once
   during app's lifetime and must have a corresponding Shutdown()
   call.
4. `cef.CreateBrowserSync(url="https://www.google.com/", ...)` - Create
   a browser synchronously, this function returns a Browser object.
5. `cef.MessageLoop()` - Run CEF message loop. All desktop GUI programs
   run some message loop that waits and dispatches events or messages.
   Read more on message loop in the "Message loop" section further
   down in this tutorial.
6. `cef.Shutdown()` - Shut down CEF. This function must be called for
   CEF to shut down cleanly. It will free system resources acquired
   by CEF and terminate all sub-processes, and it will flush to disk any
   yet unsaved data like for example cookies and/or local storage. Call
   this function at the very end of your program execution. When using
   third party GUI frameworks such as Qt/wxWidgets, CEF should be shut down
   after these frameworks' shutdown procedures were called. For example
   in Qt, shut down CEF only after QApplication object was destroyed.

Documentation for the functions referenced in this example can
be found in API reference - the [api/](../api) root directory in GitHub's
repository:

* [ExceptHook](../api/cefpython.md#excepthook)
* [Initialize](../api/cefpython.md#initialize)
* [CreateBrowserSync](../api/cefpython.md#createbrowsersync)
* [Browser](../api/Browser.md) object
* [MessageLoop](../api/cefpython.md#messageloop)
* [Shutdown](../api/cefpython.md#shutdown)


## Architecture

- CEF uses multi-process architecture
  - The main application process is called the “Browser”
    process. In CEF Python this is the same process in
    which Python is running.
  - CEF Python uses a separate executable called "subprocess"
    for running sub-processes. Sub-processes will be created
    for renderers, plugins, GPU, etc.
  - In future CEF Python might allow to run Python also in
    sub-processes, for example in the Renderer process which
    would allow to access more CEF API ([Issue #320](../../../issues/320))
- Most processes in CEF have multiple threads
  - Handlers' callbacks and other interfaces callbacks may
    be called on various threads, this is stated in API reference
  - Some functions may only be used on particular threads,
    this is stated in API reference
  - CEF Python provides cef.[PostTask](../api/cefpython.md#posttask)
    function for posting tasks between these various threads
  - The "UI" thread is application main thread unless you
    use ApplicationSettings.[multi_threaded_message_loop](../api/ApplicationSettings.md#multi_threaded_messge_loop)
    option on Windows in which case the UI thread will no more
    be application main thread
  - Do not perform blocking operations on any CEF thread other
    than the Browser process FILE thread. Otherwise this can
    lead to serious performance issues.


## Handling Python exceptions

Due to CEF multi-process architecture Python exceptions need
special handling. When Python exception occurs then main process
is terminated. For CEF this means that the Browser process is
terminated, however there may still be running CEF sub-processes
like Renderer process, GPU process, etc. To terminate these
sub-processes cef.[Shutdown](../api/cefpython.md#shutdown)
must be called and if running CEF message loop then it must be
stopped first. In all CEF Python examples you can find such
a line that overwrites the default exception handler in Python:

```
sys.excepthook = cef.ExceptHook  # To shutdown all CEF processes on error
```

See Python docs for [sys.excepthook](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook).

The cef.ExceptHook helper function does the following:
1. Calls cef.[QuitMessageLoop](../api/cefpython.md#quitmessageloop)
2. Calls cef.[Shutdown](../api/cefpython.md#shutdown)
3. Writes exception to "error.log" file
4. Prints exception
5. Calls [os._exit(1)](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os._exit) -
   which exits the process with status 1, without calling
   cleanup handlers, flushing stdio buffers, etc.

See CEF Python's ExceptHook source code [here](../../../search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22def+excepthook%28exc_type%22&type=).


## Message loop

Message loop is a programming construct that waits for and
dispatches events or messages in a program. All desktop GUI
programs must run some kind of message loop. The hello_world.py
example doesn't depend on any third party GUI framework and thus
can run CEF message loop directly by calling cef.MessageLoop().
However in other examples that embed CEF browser with GUI frameworks
such as Qt/wxPython/Tkinter you can't call cef.MessageLoop(), because
these frameworks run a message loop of its own. For such cases CEF
provides cef.MessageLoopWork() which is for integrating CEF message
loop into existing application message loop. Usually
cef.MessageLoopWork() is called in a 10ms timer.

**Performance**

Calling cef.MessageLoopWork() in a timer is not the best performant
way to run CEF message loop, also there are known bugs on some
platforms when calling message loop work in a timer. There are two
options to increase performance depending on platform. On Windows
use a multi-threaded message loop for best performance. On Mac use
an external message pump for best performance.

**Windows: multi-threaded message loop**

On Windows for best performance a multi-threaded message loop should
be used instead of cef.MessageLoopWork() or external message pump. To do
so, set ApplicationSettings.[multi_threaded_message_loop](../ApplicationSettings.md#multi_threaded_message_loop)
to True and run a native message loop in your app. Don't call CEF's
message loop. Create browser using `cef.PostTask(cef.TID_UI, cef.CreateBrowserSync, ...)`.
Note that when using multi-threaded message loop, CEF's UI thread
is no more application's main thread, and that makes it a bit harder
to correctly use CEF API. API docs explain on which threads a function
may be called and in case of handlers' callbacks (and other interfaces)
it is stated on which thread a callback will be called. See also
[Issue #133](../../../issues/133).

**Mac: external message pump**

CEF provides ApplicationSettings.[external_message_pump](../api/ApplicationSettings.md#external_message_pump)
option for running an external message pump that you should use for
best performance and to get rid of some bugs that appear when using
cef.MessageLoopWork() in a timer.

This option is currently marked experimental as it wasn't yet fully
tested. This option should work good on Mac - in upstream CEF it was
tested mainly on Mac. If you've successfully used this option on Mac
please let us know on the Forum.

**Linux**

External message pump option is not recommended to use on Linux,
as during testing it actually made app x2 slower - it's a bug in
upstream CEF. See [Issue #246](../../../issues/246) for more details.


## Settings

CEF settings are provided in multiple ways. There are global
[application settings](../api/ApplicationSettings.md#application-settings)
and [command line switches](../api/CommandLineSwitches.md#command-line-switches)
that can be passed to cef.[Initialize](../api/cefpython.md#initialize).
There are also [browser settings](../api/BrowserSettings.md#browser-settings)
that can be passed to cef.[CreateBrowserSync](../api/cefpython.md#createbrowsersync).
Finally there are Chromium preferences, but these are not yet
implemented. See below for details on each of these settings.

**Application settings**

A dict of [application settings](../api/ApplicationSettings.md#application-settings)
can be passed to cef.[Initialize](../api/cefpython.md#initialize).
Here are some settings worth noting:
- [cache_path](../api/ApplicationSettings.md#cache_path) - set
  a directory path so that web cache data is persisted, otherwise
  an in-memory cache is used. Cookies and HTML 5 databases such
  as local storage will only persist if this option is set.
- [context_menu](../api/ApplicationSettings.md#context_menu) -
  customize context menu
- [locale](../api/ApplicationSettings.md#locale) - set language
  for localized resources

To enable debugging set these settings:
```
settings = {
    "debug": True,
    "log_severity": cef.LOGSEVERITY_WARNING,
    "log_file": "debug.log",
}
cef.Initialize(settings=settings)
```

Alternatively you can pass `--debug` flag on the command line
and these settings will be set automatically.

**Browser settings**

A dict of [browser settings](../api/BrowserSettings.md#browser-settings)
can be passed to cef.[CreateBrowserSync](../api/cefpython.md#createbrowsersync).

**Command line switches**

A dict of [command line switches](../api/CommandLineSwitches.md)
can be passed to cef.[Initialize](../api/cefpython.md#initialize).
Examples switches:
- "enable-media-stream" - to enable media (WebRTC audio/video) streaming
- "proxy-server" - to set proxy server
- "disable-gpu" - use only CPU software rendering

Example code:

```
switches = {
    "enable-media-stream": "",
    "proxy-server": "socks5://127.0.0.1:8888",
    "disable-gpu": "",
}
cef.Initialize(switches=switches)
```

Note that when setting switch that doesn't accept value then
must pass an empty string as value.


**Chromium preferences**

There are lots of more settings that can be set using Chromium
preferences (and even changed during runtime), however this API
wasn't yet exposed to CEF Python, see [Issue #244](../../../issues/244)
for details.


## Client handlers

In CEF [client handlers](../api/API-categories.md#client-handlers-interfaces)
provide a way to be notified of Chromium events. There are client
handlers like DisplayHandler, LoadHandler, RequestHandler, etc.
These handlers are class interfaces for which you provide
implementation. We will refer to the methods of these objects
as "callbacks". You can set a client handler by calling
Browser.[SetClientHandler](../api/Browser.md#setclienthandler).
You are not required to implement whole interface, you can implement
only some callbacks. Some handlers due to cefpython limitations
have callbacks that can only be set globally by calling
cef.[SetGlobalClientCallback](../api/cefpython.md#setglobalclientcallback).
In API reference such global client callbacks are marked with an
underscore in its name.

The [tutorial.py](../examples/tutorial.py) example shows how to
implement client handlers like [DisplayHandler](../api/DisplayHandler.md)
and [LoadHandler](../api/LoadHandler.md). It also shows how to
implement a global client callback LifespanHandler.[_OnAfterCreated](../api/LifespanHandler.md#_onaftercreated). Here is some source code:

```
set_client_handlers(browser)
...
def set_client_handlers(browser):
    client_handlers = [LoadHandler(), DisplayHandler()]
    for handler in client_handlers:
        browser.SetClientHandler(handler)
...
class LoadHandler(object):
    def OnLoadingStateChange(self, browser, is_loading, **_):
        if not is_loading:
            # Loading is complete
            js_print(browser, "Python: LoadHandler.OnLoadingStateChange:"
                              "loading is complete")
```


## Javascript integration

Python code is running in the main process (the Browser process),
while Javascript is running in the Renderer sub-process. Communication
between Python and Javascript is possible either using inter-process
asynchronous messaging or through http requests (both sync and
async possible).

**Asynchronous inter-process messaging**

Python and Javascript can communicate using inter-process
messaging:
 - Use the [JavascriptBindings](../api/JavascriptBindings.md)
   class methods to to expose Python functions, objects and properties
   to Javascript: [SetFunction](../api/JavascriptBindings.md#setfunctions),
   [SetObject](../api/JavascriptBindings.md#setobject)
   and [SetProperty](../api/JavascriptBindings.md#setproperty)
 - To initiate communication from the Python side call
   Browser object methods: [ExecuteJavascript](../api/Browser.md#executejavascript)
   or [ExecuteFunction](../api/Browser.md#executefunction).
   Frame object also has the same methods.
 - To initiate communication from the Javascript side first
   you have to bind Python functions/objects using the
   JavascriptBindings class mentioned earlier. Then you call
   these functions/objects.
 - You can pass Javascript callbacks to Python. Just pass a
   javascript function as an argument when calling Python
   function/object. On the Python side that javascript function
   will be converted to [JavascriptCallback](../api/JavascriptCallback.md)
   object. Execute the [Call](../api/JavascriptCallback.md#call)
   method on it to call the javascript function asynchronously.
 - You can pass Python callbacks to Javascript, however you
   can do so only after the communication was initiated from
   the Javascript side and a javascript callback was passed.
   When executing JavascriptCallback.[Call](../api/JavascriptCallback.md#call)
   method you can pass Python callbacks to Javascript. In
   javascript these Python callbacks will act as native
   javascript functions, so call them as usual.
 - Note that when executing Browser.[ExecuteFunction](../api/Browser.md#executefunction) method you cannot pass Python functions
   nor objects here. Such feature is not yet supported. You can
   however pass Python functions when executing javascript
   callbacks mentioned earlier.

In tutorial.py example you will find example code that uses
javascript bindings and other APIs mentioned above.

**Communication using http requests**

Python and Javascript can also communicate using http requests
by running an internal web-server. See for example [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html)
in Python docs.

With http requests it is possible for synchronous
communication from Javascript to Python by performing
synchronous AJAX requests.

To initiate communication from the Python side call
Browser object methods: [ExecuteJavascript](../api/Browser.md#executejavascript)
or [ExecuteFunction](../api/Browser.md#executefunction).
Frame object also has the same methods.

You can also serve requests directly in CEF using for example
[ResourceHandler](../api/ResourceHandler.md) object. You can find
an example usage of this object in one of examples listed in
the [Examples-README.md](../examples/Examples-README.md) file.

On a side note, upstream CEF also supports custom scheme handlers,
however these APIs were not yet exposed to CEF Python.


## Javascript exceptions and Python exceptions

There are cases when executing Javascript code may end up with
Python exception being thrown:

1. When a Python function is invoked from Javascript and it fails,
   a Python exception will be thrown
2. When Python executes a Javascript callback and it fails,
   a Python exception will be thrown

In other cases to see Javascript exceptions open Developer Tools
window using mouse context menu and switch to Console tab.

There are multiple ways to catch/intercept javascript exceptions:

1. In Javascript you can register "window.onerror" event to
   catch all Javascript exceptions
2. In Python you can intercept Javascript exceptions using
   DisplayHandler.[OnConsoleMessage](../api/DisplayHandler.md#onconsolemessage)
3. In upstream CEF there is also CefRenderProcessHandler::OnUncaughtException
   callback for catching Javascript exceptions, however this
   wasn't yet exposed to CEF Python


## Plugins and Flash support

Latest CEF supports only [PPAPI plugins](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/pepper-plugin-implementation).
NPAPI plugins are no more supported.

Instructions for enabling Flash support are available in [Issue #235](../../../issues/235) ("Flash support in CEF 51+").

For the old CEF Python v31 release instructions for enabling Flash
support are available on Wiki pages.


## Build executable

There are no official examples for building executable using
python packaging tools, however some resources and tips are
available, see these issues in the tracker:

* Pyinstaller - see [Issue #135](../../../issues/135)
* py2exe - see [Issue #35](../../../issues/35)
* py2app - see [Issue #337](../../../issues/337)
* cx_Freeze - see [Issue #338](../../../issues/338)

If you have any problems building executable ask on the [Forum](https://groups.google.com/group/cefpython).

**Files in the cefpython3 package**

The cefpython3 package has the following components:
1. The CEF Python modules (cefpython_pyxx.pyd on Windows,
   cefpython_pyxx.so on Linux/Mac)
2. The CEF dynamic library (libcef.dll on Windows, libcef.so on Linux,
   “Chromium Embedded Framework.framework” on OS X).
3. Other dynamic libraries CEF depends on (libEGL, libGLES,
   d3dcompiler, etc.) and some optional (widevinecdmadapter, etc.)
4. Support files (*.pak, *.dat, *.bin, etc).

See README.txt in the cefpython3 package which provides
extended details about all CEF binary files.
