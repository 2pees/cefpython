### Questions and problems

Ask questions and report problems on the ![CEF Python Forum](https://www.google.com/images/icons/material/product/1x/groups_24dp.png)
[CEF Python Forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cefpython).

Before creating an issue in the tracker it is best to discuss it first on the Forum. When creating issue include information like: OS, Python version, library version (wxPython etc), cefpython version and say which example you're running (try to reproduce your issue with one of official cefpython examples).
